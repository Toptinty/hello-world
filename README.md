Hello there! I am Jonathan. A "Semi-Programmer" that loves programming with microcontrollers, however still has much to learn about those and other IOT devices. My favirote MCU is the ESP32-C3, because of its ease of implimentation onto circuit boards (it was actually used in the first ever PCB [Printed circuit board] that I designed and built) and wifi & bluetooth capabilities. 

In terms of non-nerd related things, I enjoy playing the bass guitar, and drums. And Im a student pilot at KIPJ. Thanks for reading! Toodles!
